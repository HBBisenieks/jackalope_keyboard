# PCBs
The current revision of the boards, both split and monoblock, are under `v2_0/`. As previously, 
these boards are theoretically functional but untested, pending both firmware authoring (QMK and 
KMK support planned) and arrival of the prototype boards from JLCPCB.

## To-Do:
- [ ] Write QMK code
- [ ] Write KMK code
- [ ] Verify PCBs
- [ ] Build guide
- [ ] BOM

~The current revision of PCB uploaded to GH is routed but untested and reflects an older revision of the code than what's available in the base of the repo. It _might_ work, but I honestly put it together to learn a bit more about using KiCad than anything else and haven't yet tested the outline, so, you know, caveat emptor.~
