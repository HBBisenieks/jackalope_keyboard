# PCBs
The current revision of PCB uploaded to GH is routed but untested and reflects an older revision of the code than what's available in the base of the repo. It _might_ work, but I honestly put it together to learn a bit more about using KiCad than anything else and haven't yet tested the outline, so, you know, caveat emptor.
